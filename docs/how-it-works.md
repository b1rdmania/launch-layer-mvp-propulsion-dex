## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Set Your Price:** Decide on a fair, fixed price for your token sale.
2. **Deploy On-Chain:** Use our factory contract to launch your sale—everything is transparent and enforced by smart contracts on Sonic.
3. **Community Participation:**
   - **Guaranteed Allocation:** Reward your early supporters or community members with guaranteed spots (via whitelisting or other criteria).
   - **First-Come, First-Served:** Any remaining tokens are available to the wider community, ensuring everyone has a chance to participate.
4. **Public Sale:** If tokens remain, anyone can join until the allocation is filled or the sale ends.
5. **Claim & Grow:** After the sale, participants claim their tokens and your project is ready to grow!
