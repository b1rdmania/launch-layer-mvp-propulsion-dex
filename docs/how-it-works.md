# ⚙️ How It Works: The Launch Layer Process

Launching your token on Launch Layer is designed to be a transparent and straightforward on-chain experience. Here's a breakdown of the core stages involved when a project launches with us:

### 1. 🪙 Set the Price
Project teams decide on a fair, fixed price for their token. This transparency is fundamental to building community trust from day one.

### 2. ⛓️ Deploy On-Chain
Using Launch Layer's factory contract, the project team deploys their sale. All parameters and mechanics are immutably stored and executed on the Sonic network, ensuring complete transparency.

### 3. 👥 Community Participation Rounds
Launch Layer facilitates distinct phases to ensure equitable participation:
*   **🛡️ Guaranteed Allocation (Whitelist/GTD):** Projects can reward early supporters, contributors, or specific community segments with guaranteed spots to contribute.
*   **💨 First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** After any guaranteed phase (or as the primary method), tokens become available to the broader community, ensuring wider access until the allocation is filled.

### 4. 📢 Public Sale (If Applicable)
Should tokens remain after the initial community rounds, these are typically made available to the general public until the total sale allocation is met or the sale period concludes, as defined by the project.

### 5. 💸 Claim & Cultivate
Once the sale is finalized and the Token Generation Event (TGE) occurs, participants can claim their tokens according to the schedule set by the project (which may include vesting). The project is now funded and ready to grow with its new token holders!
