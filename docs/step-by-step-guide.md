# 📖 Step-by-Step Guide: Participating in a Launch

Ready to get involved in a Launch Layer token sale? Here's what you need to do:

1.  **Stay Informed & Check Eligibility:**
    *   Follow the project's announcements for sale dates, times, and token details.
    *   Carefully review the eligibility criteria. Some sales might have whitelist spots or specific requirements.
    *   All official sale information will be available on the Launch Layer interface for that specific launch.

2.  **Connect Your Wallet:**
    *   On the day of the sale, navigate to the project's launch page on Launch Layer.
    *   Connect your Sonic-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask configured for Sonic).
    *   Ensure your wallet is funded with the necessary tokens for participation (e.g., $SONIC or stablecoins, as specified by the sale).

3.  **Contribute Funds:**
    *   Once the sale phase you're eligible for is active (e.g., Whitelist, FCFS), the contribution interface will open.
    *   Enter the amount you wish to contribute, up to any specified maximum allocation.
    *   Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

4.  **Claim Your Tokens:**
    *   After the sale concludes and the token generation event (TGE) occurs, tokens will become claimable.
    *   Return to the Launch Layer page for that sale.
    *   Follow the instructions to claim your tokens to your wallet.
    *   Be aware of any vesting schedules if the project has implemented one – you may claim portions of your tokens over time.
