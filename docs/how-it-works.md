# ⚙️ How It Works: The Launch Layer Process

Launching your token on Launch Layer is designed to be a transparent and straightforward on-chain experience. Here's a breakdown of the core stages involved when a project launches with us:

| Stage # | Stage Name                      | Key Activities / Description                                                                                                                               | Responsibility     |
| :------ | :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| 1       | 🪙 **Set the Price**            | Project teams decide on a fair, fixed price for their token. This transparency is fundamental to building community trust from day one.                        | Project Team       |
| 2       | ⛓️ **Deploy On-Chain**          | Using Launch Layer's factory contract, the project team deploys their sale. All parameters and mechanics are immutably stored and executed on the Sonic network. | Project Team       |
| 3       | 👥 **Community Rounds**         | Facilitate distinct phases: <br> • **🛡️ Guaranteed Allocation (Whitelist/GTD):** Reward key supporters. <br> • **💨 FCFS:** Open access for broader community.     | Project Team / LL Platform |
| 4       | 📢 **Public Sale (Optional)**   | If tokens remain, they are made available to the general public until allocation is met or sale period ends, as defined by the project.                  | Project Team       |
| 5       | 💸 **Claim & Cultivate**        | Post-TGE, participants claim tokens per schedule (vesting may apply). Project is funded and ready to grow!                                                 | Participants / Project Team |

> **ℹ️ Note:** Every step of a Launch Layer sale is conducted on-chain via smart contracts. This means verifiable fairness and complete transparency for both project teams and participants.
