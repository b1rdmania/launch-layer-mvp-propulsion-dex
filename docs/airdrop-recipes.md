# 🎁 Understanding Airdrops on Launch Layer

Airdrops are a popular way for projects to distribute tokens, reward community members, and bootstrap their ecosystem. On Launch Layer, we champion an approach to airdrops that is on-chain, transparent, and empowers individual projects.

## 🌟 Key Principles for Airdrops with Launch Layer

While specific airdrop mechanics are designed and implemented by each project, Launch Layer encourages adherence to these core principles for any distribution leveraging the Sonic network:

*   **🔗 On-Chain & Transparent:** All eligibility criteria and distribution processes should be verifiable on-chain, ensuring fairness and clarity for everyone involved.
*   **🛠️ Project Autonomy:** Projects have full control over their airdrop design, including eligibility, token amounts, and claim mechanisms. Launch Layer does not impose a one-size-fits-all model.
*   **🙌 Community First:** Airdrops should aim to reward genuine contributors, early supporters, and active community members, fostering a strong and engaged user base.
*   **⛔ No Platform Hoops:** Users should not be required to hold a specific Launch Layer platform token or jump through unnecessary hoops to claim airdrops from projects building on Sonic. Eligibility should be based on a project's own defined criteria.

## 👤 Participating in an Airdrop (For Users)

If a project announces an airdrop that utilizes Launch Layer principles or infrastructure:

1.  **📢 Follow Project Announcements:** The best source for airdrop news, eligibility, and claim instructions is always the official communication channels of the project conducting the airdrop.
2.  **🔗 Connect to Claim (If Applicable):** Projects will typically provide a dedicated webpage or interface where eligible users can connect their Sonic-compatible wallet to check eligibility and claim their tokens.
3.  **✅ Verify Eligibility:** The project's interface will usually allow you to check if your wallet address meets the specified criteria (e.g., held an NFT at a snapshot date, interacted with a dApp, etc.).
4.  **💸 Claim Securely:** If eligible, you'll be able to initiate a transaction from your wallet to claim the tokens directly. Remember, you only sign transactions on sites you trust.

## 🚀 Launching an Airdrop (For Projects)

Projects looking to conduct an airdrop on Sonic can embrace the Launch Layer ethos:

*   **🎯 Define Clear Objectives & Eligibility:** What is the goal of your airdrop? Who do you want to reward? Clearly define your target audience and the snapshot or interaction criteria.
*   **🔒 Secure Distribution Mechanism:** Consider using transparent, audited smart contracts for distribution. Common methods include Merkle tree-based claims (efficient for large, specific lists) or simple time-locked distribution contracts.
*   **📢 Communicate Effectively:** Provide clear, timely, and accessible information to your community about the airdrop's purpose, eligibility, how to claim, and the claim period.
*   **💡 Consider Phased or Milestone-Based Airdrops:** Instead of a single large drop, you might engage your community over time with multiple smaller airdrops tied to specific contributions or milestones.

## 🤔 Common Airdrop Models & Ideas

Projects often use a variety of models for their airdrops, including:

*   **🖼️ NFT Holder Airdrops:** Distributing tokens to wallets that hold specific NFTs (from your project or a partner project).
*   **💰 Token Holder Snapshots:** Airdropping to wallets that held a certain amount of another token (e.g., your project's governance token if launching a new utility token, or a related ecosystem token) at a specific block height.
*   **🧪 Testnet Participant Rewards:** Rewarding users who actively participated in your testnet phase, providing valuable feedback.
*   **🗳️ Governance Participation Incentives:** Encouraging involvement by airdropping to users who have voted on proposals or participated in governance.
*   **🎉 Early Adopter & User Activity Rewards:** Distributing tokens based on early usage of your dApp or specific valuable interactions.

> **ℹ️ Note:** Launch Layer aims to provide robust, decentralized infrastructure and best-practice guidance. However, the design, execution, and responsibility for any specific airdrop rest entirely with the project team conducting it. Always Do Your Own Research (DYOR) and verify information from official project sources.

By fostering fair and transparent airdrop practices, Launch Layer supports projects in building strong, decentralized communities on the Sonic network.
