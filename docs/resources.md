# ℹ️ Launch Layer Resources

Welcome to the central hub for all things Launch Layer! Here you'll find essential links, guides, and information to help you navigate our platform and the wider Sonic ecosystem.

## &#x20;The Launch Layer NFT

* The Launch Layer NFT is a special token designed to reward early adopters and active community members. (This is a conceptual placeholder sentence)
* Further details regarding its utility, total supply, distribution methods, and how to acquire it will be announced through our official channels. Stay tuned for updates!

## Bridging to the Sonic Network

Moving your assets to the Sonic network is your gateway to participating in launches and engaging with the ecosystem. Here's a general guide:

1. **Choose a Bridge:** Utilize a reputable bridge that supports Sonic.&#x20;
2. **Connect Your Wallet:** Securely connect your EVM-compatible wallet (like MetaMask) to the bridge interface.
3. **Select Assets & Transfer:** Choose the asset you wish to bridge and the amount. Follow the on-screen instructions carefully.
4. **Confirm Transactions:** You'll typically need to approve the token spending and then confirm the bridging transaction in your wallet.
5. **Receive Assets on Sonic:** After a processing period, your assets will arrive in your wallet on the Sonic network.
6. **Acquire $S for Gas:** Ensure you have $S tokens in your wallet to pay for transaction fees (gas) on the Sonic network. You can usually acquire $S on a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates on Sonic.

> **Important:** Always double-check bridge URLs and be cautious of phishing sites. Transaction times can vary. Only bridge assets you understand and are comfortable with.

## For Developers

Launch Layer is committed to open-source principles.

* Our smart contracts and platform infrastructure are (or will be) publicly available for review and integration.
* Developers can find more information, including contract addresses and integration guides, on our [GitHub Repository](YOUR_GITHUB_LINK_HERE/).

## Partners & Integrations

Launch Layer thrives on collaboration and aims to integrate seamlessly with the broader Sonic ecosystem.

* We are proud to collaborate with leading projects, infrastructure providers, and security auditors.
* Official partners and key integrations will be announced and featured here as they are formalized.

## Staying Safe in Web3

Navigating the decentralized web requires vigilance. Here are some essential safety tips:

* **Protect Your Keys:** Never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone. Store them securely offline.
* **Verify URLs:** Always triple-check website addresses (URLs) before connecting your wallet or signing transactions. Bookmark official sites.
* **Beware of DMs & Scams:** Be highly skeptical of unsolicited direct messages (DMs) offering help, airdrops, or investment opportunities. Admins and team members will rarely DM you first with such offers.
* **Signatures Matter:** Understand what you are signing. Read transaction details carefully in your wallet before confirming.
* **DYOR (Do Your Own Research):** Always research projects thoroughly before participating or investing.
