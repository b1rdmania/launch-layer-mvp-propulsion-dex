# ðŸš€ Welcome to Launch Layer Docs

Launch Layer is your open-source, community-powered launchpad for the Sonic network. We believe in making token launches accessible, transparent, and fair for everyoneâ€”no gatekeeping, no platform tokens, and no unnecessary complexity. Whether you're a builder or a participant, Launch Layer gives you the tools to create, join, and grow new projects with confidence.

Our mission is to empower the next wave of DeFi innovation by providing neutral, permissionless infrastructure for clean, fixed-price token launches. Everything is on-chain, non-custodial, and designed for simplicity.
