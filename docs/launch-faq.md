# Frequently Asked Questions (Launching)

Here are some common questions project teams have about launching their token on Launch Layer:

<details>
<summary>Can I use Launch Layer for other types of token sales besides fixed price?</summary>

Not at this moment. Launch Layer is currently specialized in fixed-price launches to ensure simplicity, fairness, and clarity. We believe this model offers the most straightforward path for new projects and their communities. We may explore other auction models in the future based on evolving needs and community feedback.
