# Launch Layer Documentation

Welcome to the Launch Layer documentation! This site provides everything you need to understand, use, and contribute to Launch Layer—the permissionless, tokenless launchpad for clean, fixed-price token raises on the Sonic network.

Launch Layer provides smart contracts, tooling, and frontend components for transparent public token sales, with integration for Hedgey Finance post-sale vesting. It is designed for serious DeFi builders—no platform token, no raffles, no bonding curves, and no unnecessary complexity. The platform is neutral infrastructure: it does not hold user funds (post-sweep), offer investment advice, or issue its own token. Project teams are responsible for their own launches and outcomes.
