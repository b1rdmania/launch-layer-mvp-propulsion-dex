# ðŸš€ Launch Your Token

## Why Launch on Launch Layer?

Launch Layer is the easiest way to launch your token on Sonic. Our platform is open-source, community-driven, and designed for transparency and fairness. With a single, fixed price launch model, you get a straightforward, no-nonsense experienceâ€”no platform tokens, no hidden fees, and no complicated mechanics.

## How It Works

1. **Set Your Price:** Decide on a fair, fixed price for your token sale.
2. **Deploy On-Chain:** Use our factory contract to launch your saleâ€”everything is transparent and enforced by smart contracts on Sonic.
3. **Community Participation:**
   - **Guaranteed Allocation:** Reward your early supporters or community members with guaranteed spots (via whitelisting or other criteria).
   - **First-Come, First-Served:** Any remaining tokens are available to the wider community, ensuring everyone has a chance to participate.
4. **Public Sale:** If tokens remain, anyone can join until the allocation is filled or the sale ends.
5. **Claim & Grow:** After the sale, participants claim their tokens and your project is ready to grow!

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Review your eligibility and sale details on Launch Layer.
2. Connect your wallet and follow the on-screen steps.
