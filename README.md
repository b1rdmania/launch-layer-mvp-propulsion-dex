# Propulsion Finance DEX – Sonic Mainnet MVP

A next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) for Sonic mainnet, featuring token swaps, liquidity management, and LP NFT positions—built with Next.js, Wagmi, RainbowKit, and Algebra V4 contracts.

## Project Description

Propulsion Finance DEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) MVP built for the Sonic mainnet. It enables users to:

- Instantly swap between supported tokens using Algebra V4 contracts
- Add or remove liquidity to pools and mint LP NFTs
- View, manage, and collect fees from their liquidity positions
- Connect seamlessly with wallets via RainbowKit, Wagmi, and Viem

The DEX is built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and is pre-configured for Sonic tokens and contracts (pending final mainnet periphery addresses).
