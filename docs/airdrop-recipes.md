# 🎉 Claimable Airdrops

Airdrops on Launch Layer are all about rewarding your community and growing your project in a fair, transparent way. Everything happens on-chain—no middlemen, no platform tokens, and no hidden requirements. Whether you're a user or a protocol, Launch Layer makes it easy to participate in or run airdrop campaigns.

## 👤 For Users

- Discover and claim airdrops from a single, easy-to-use dashboard. (TODO: Confirm if Launch Layer has a UI for airdrop claims)
- Each project sets its own eligibility rules; you don't need to hold a platform token or join a sale unless the project says so.
- All claims are non-custodial and handled directly by your wallet.

## 🏗️ For Protocols

- Launch custom airdrop campaigns to engage your community. (TODO: Confirm if Launch Layer supports this and how)
- Choose who's eligible (NFTs, tokens, whitelists, etc.).
- Set up snapshot timing and allocation logic.
- Deposit tokens into secure smart contracts for distribution—no third-party custody.
