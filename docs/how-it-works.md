# ⚙️ How It Works: The Launch Layer Process

Launching your token on Launch Layer is a straightforward, on-chain process. Here's a breakdown of the key stages:

1. **Set Your Price:**
   Decide on a fair, fixed price for your token sale. This transparency is key to building trust with your community.

2. **Deploy On-Chain:**
   Use our factory contract to launch your sale. Everything is transparent and enforced by immutable smart contracts on the Sonic network.

3. **Community Participation Rounds:**
   * **Guaranteed Allocation (Whitelist/GTD):** Reward your early supporters, contributors, or specific community segments with guaranteed spots to participate.
   * **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** After the guaranteed phase, any remaining tokens become available to the broader community, ensuring wider access.

4. **Public Sale (If Applicable):**
   If tokens remain after the community rounds, they are typically opened up to the general public until the allocation is filled or the sale period concludes.

5. **Claim & Grow:**
   Once the sale is finalized, participants can claim their tokens according to the schedule you've set. Now, your project is funded and ready to grow with its new token holders!
