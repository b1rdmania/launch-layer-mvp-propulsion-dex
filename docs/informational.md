## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Disclosure

Participating in token sales and interacting with blockchain technology involves significant risks. Please carefully consider the following:

* **Market Volatility:** The value of cryptographic tokens can be extremely volatile and can result in significant financial loss.
* **Smart Contract Risks:** Smart contracts are susceptible to bugs, errors, and exploits. Despite best efforts and audits (by projects), vulnerabilities may exist that could lead to loss of funds.
* **Project Risks:** Many projects in the cryptocurrency space are new and experimental. There is no guarantee of their success, utility, or the future value of their tokens.
* **No Guarantees or Refunds:** All transactions on the blockchain are irreversible. Launch Layer cannot reverse transactions or recover lost funds. Participation in token sales is at your own risk, and there is no guarantee of returns.
* **Regulatory Uncertainty:** The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and token sales is evolving and varies by jurisdiction. You are responsible for understanding and complying with any applicable regulations.
